abstract = {In order to enhance the liquidity and stability of ancillary service markets in Europe and to motivate the participation of renewable energy resources, the incorporation of control reserve procurement into day-ahead power exchanges (PXs) is proposed. The design of the corresponding clearing algorithm is presented in detail. The model allows the submission of combined energy-reserve orders and guarantees that opportunity costs of power producers are taken into account. It can also handle non-convex offers (e.g. block bids) and market coupling that are essential components of European PX designs. The formulated optimization problem can be classified as a convex Mixed Integer Quadratic Program; consequently, its solution can be found using readily available generic solvers. A numerical simulation is executed for the purpose of demonstration and also to make a comparison between joint and separated allocation of energy and reserves. The simple initial analysis suggests that the proposed integration approach is beneficial.}
