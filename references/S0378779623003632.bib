abstract = {Electricity market integration is an ongoing process in the European power sector. One of its important development areas concerns the integrated, combined trading of different power system products such as energy and control reserves. However, the complicated technical and economic characteristics of generators pose challenges for simple energy-reserve offers. Our solution approach is to unify them with complex orders. The latter have been introduced to represent special generator characteristics on the currently operating European energy-only market. The unified order type is designed to keep all the advantageous properties and functionality of its predecessors. Similarly to simple energy-reserve offers, the decision between energy and control reserve products takes opportunity costs into account. This is a necessary property of optimal capacity allocation. The non-convex fixed costs of suppliers are represented using Minimum Income Conditions and Scheduled Stop Conditions while their ramping limits are handled by Load Gradient Conditions. All three of these components belong to complex orders originally. The resulting new model can be formulated in a single convex Mixed Integer Quadratic Program, and it is fully compatible with European market rules. The viability and adequacy of the proposal are demonstrated using numerical case studies.}
